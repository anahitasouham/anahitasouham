# Hi everyone! 👋

I am Anahita, a recent MORSE graduate from the University of Warwick and passionate about the intersection of **data analysis, quantitative finance** and **creative problem-solving**.

Curious and eager to keep learning, I'm currently expanding my **HTML, CSS and Javascript** skills through Coursera courses to better understand the technology behind data-driven products. 
I previously took part in the **Kode With Klossy Mobile App Development** program (Summer 2023), which first sparked my interest in coding and building structured, logic-driven projects.

🌍 Based in Paris | Previously in Toronto | Fluent in English and French | Eligible to work in Europe, the UK, and Canada
📲 Currently refining my GitHub profile to give it a more professional look, as it has so far served as a space for personal skill development and experimentation.

### 🧠 What I’m working on
- Strengthening my foundation in **model-driven analytics** and quantitative reasoning
- Building projects that combine **finance, risk management, and data visualisation**
- Expanding my skills in **Python**, **R**, **VBA**, and **statistical modelling**
